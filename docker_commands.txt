After creating the Dockerfile and the index.php file, the following docker commands are to be run:

* docker build -t my-php-app => This command builds a dockerr image with the required specifications in the Dockerfile.
                             => The -t flag is used to tag the image with the name my-php-app.

* docker run -it --rm --name my-running-app my-php-app => This command runs the docker image and creates a container with the name my-running-app.
                                                       => The -it flag tells the container to run in interactive mode.
                                                       => The --rm flag tells the container to remove itself after it has finished running.

Now this will run the contents of our php file in the terminal.

However, to run the php file on localhost, we will use the following command:

* docker run -d -p 80:80 --name my-apache-php-app -v ${PWD}:/var/www/html php:7.2-apache => This command runs the docker image, mapping the port 80 of the local machine to port 80 of the server. 
                                                                                         => This will allow us to access the php file on localhost.
                                                                                         => The -d flag tells the container to run in detached mode.
                                                                                         => The -p flag tells the container to map the port 80 of the local machine to port 80 of the server.
                                                                                         => The --name flag tells the container to name it my-apache-php-app.
                                                                                         => The -v flag tells the container to mount the current directory to the /var/www/html directory.
                                                                                         => php:7.2-apache is the name of the docker image for the apache server, on which we are running the php scripts.
